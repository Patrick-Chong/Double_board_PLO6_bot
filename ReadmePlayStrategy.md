Strategy I will employ based on reading more PLO books and my own experience/knowledge: 

1) When deciding Starting Hands to play, need to consider position; 
In position (pos6 or pos5) and folded to you, you can of course open slightly weaker, weaker in the sense that the nuttiness of the hand 
can go down, because you have the benefit of information if it goes to post flop!

Very good example of why playing non-nutty hands in position is okay, and why playing it out of position is NOT okay. 

2) Style of play will be tight pre-flop and aggro post flop; that is why I will only play hands in position
because it allows for the latter part of that strategy, especially if I am in heads up.
